# KAKU/COCO
KAKU control with Adruino

It's a 2 part system:

1. The Input to a PHP script running on my Synology with background passtrue to the Arduino
2. The Arduino Code for reading the PHP call and translate this to 433 COCO control.

This code is just for inspiration as this is just a stripped part of my home interfacing with the Arduino.
